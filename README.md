# About

SMORES is a texture pack designed with additional ease-of-use in mind for players with colorblindness (namely tritan-type CVDs), featuring distinctive ore and wood/plank textures in addition to overall aesthetic changes for everyone to enjoy. It is still very much a work in progress!

# Using SMORES

Throw the ZIP file into your resource pack folder, same as any other pack. You have pretty much free reign to use it, including in videos/streams! (see Terms of Use for more info).

# Modifying SMORES

Ask me for permission first, please. (again, check Terms for info)  So long as I've given you the go-ahead, go for it! I'd love to see what you come up with :)  


# Contact

Any questions, suggestions, requests, or bug reports can be sent to CactusMCmail@gmail.com with the version and feedback type in the subject line (ex: "1.16-1.0a Bug Report", "Suggestion for 21w16a-2.4b"). Be as specific as you can- "it doesn't work" can mean many things!
